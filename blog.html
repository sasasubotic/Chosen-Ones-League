<div class="border">
	<div class="post">
		<div class="date">Eric "VP"</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4430027.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Sam LaPorta</h4>
					<p>
					Let's consider why Eric chose Mr. LaPorta. My theory is that it sounds like Laporte, and he misses James. But some would say that it perhaps has to do with the fast pace
						offense of the Lions, a weak division, and a reported strong camp by the rookie TE, as well as filling a hole with the Hockenson departure. I lean to my first hypothesis.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3068267.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Austin Ekeler</h4>
					<p>
					This is mildly disrespectful, but I wholely understand his point. Ekeler went from a 3-10 touchdown a season guy to a near 20 average a season these past 2 seasons. Eric is 
						clearly predicting the RB decline and the touchdown regression, and potentially new targets on the Chargers slowing Mr.Ekeler down. 
					</p>
				</div>

		<div class="date">James "Utah"</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4379399.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - James Cook</h4>
					<p>
						<font color=#ff8000>cough</font> Picking your own player again huh?<font color=#ff8000>cough</font>
						Classic James. 3 years in a row. Utah changes nobody. Cook is a solid runningback. 
						Problem is he's on a team allergic to running the ball and allergic to passing to runningbacks. Unless its goalline. Then their RB1, Josh Allen takes it.
						Bad take James. 
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4035687.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Michael Pittman</h4>
					<p>
						Here is what I will say. Pittman is a talented guy. A monster. I mean last year, he got 141 targets. Albeit, it was Matt Ryan targets. Now he gets targets from a QB who completed 
						53% of his passes in college. There is also reports they plan to run the hell out the ball with Taylor/Richardson so I expect Pittman to be a bust as well. not shabby.
					</p>
				</div>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="date">Bryan "Moon-Man" </div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4240703.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Kenny Pickett</h4>
					<p>
					I love this pick but I also hate it. I love it because he is in a prime position to play better in year 2 with a better line, and supposedly a monster camp. I hate it because of 
						Matt Canada, the OC, who remained after last year. I hope the kid does well. Nice one.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4569173.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Rhamondre Stevenson</h4>
					<p>
						Interesting take from Bryan. I think this is more indicative of the Patriots rough schedule + offensive line troubles + a shaky last year. However, their offense has
						been humming in camp as of late. So I think this is a fine pick, but its also possibly Bryan eats some crow here.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="date">Aaron "The Trophy-Buster"div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3045138.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Mike Williams</h4>
					<p>
						<font color=#ff8000>cough</font> Picking your own player again huh?<font color=#ff8000>cough</font>
						Well, 3rd year in a row of picking your own player. Hopefully he's better than.. Ty'Son Williams.. lol. But I will say this is an interesting pick because Mike Will had 
						a good year until his injury (900 yards in 13 games), and he has been gifted a new OC who may or may not target him as often. This is a fun pick. Even if its because you have him. again. again.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/15795.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - DeAndre Hopkins</h4>
					<p>
					Well, this is fun. Hopkins is undoubtedly talented. He racked up 700 yards in 9 games. His only problem is he is now the #1 WR on a offense dedicated to ramming the ball down the other teams 
						defensive line. And he also has a undoubtedly worse QB than Kyler Murray. And his average depth of target has regressed incredibly quickly. This is a safe pick, if boring.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="date">Tre "Habitual Line Stepper"</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4426502.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Drake London</h4>
					<p>
					You can have him for 3-5 first round picks buddy. Jokes aside, this is a safe pick by Tre, even if its a homer pick. He is a second year WR, and came on late with.. Mr.Ridder 
						at the helm of the offense. For reference, he put up 85 yards a game with Ridder. My only issue is that the offense is very run heavy with a dynamic Bijan.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/2977187.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Coopah Kupp</h4>
					<p>
						I love this take. Granted, now we know Kupp is on IR, but his hamstring seemed to be built like mine, which isn't great. Not to mention his QBs are all out, and hammy 
						injuries never look good. This is a good safe pick me thinks.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="date">Andrew "Ze Mute"</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4697815.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Rachaad White</h4>
					<p>
						<font color=#ff8000>cough</font> Picking your own player again huh?<font color=#ff8000>cough</font>
						Welp, I have to say, I don't get it. White hasn't been great at anything. He caught a ton of passes, sure, but that was with RB Dumpoff master Brady. And now its Baker at the helm. This pick is... fun lol.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4241457.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Najee Harris</h4>
					<p>
						Predicting a Warren backfield split at least I see. I kinda agree. Najee is good. Boring but good, like a mildly seasoned piece of chicken at McDonalds. Now..
						If that same meal is served at a Ruth Chris, we got a problem. McDonalds is round 5-6 ADP, and Ruth Chris is round 2-4, where Najee fell.

			<div class="date">Will "Da Champ"</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4430807.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Bijan Robinson</h4>
						<p>
						Uh ya know. I don't know who's sleeping on Bijan. I feel like you'd need a gallon of melatonin to sleep on him. But, hey, thats our champ. For now.
					</p>
					</div>
	
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4360310.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Trevor Lawrence</h4>
						<p>
						Man. This is a hater pick. But I get it. Lawrence got a lot of hype this offseason, for some good and bad reasons. Good is Ridley + his division sucks. Bad because.. well..
							his division sucks. So they could just run the ball on half the teams here. We'll see how this goes. Interesting pick here, unlike the sleeper.
					</div>
				</div>
				</div>

			<div class="date">Nando "WR Whisperer"</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4035886.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Khalil Herbert</h4>
						<p>
						Okay, so normally I get mad about people picking their guys, but Herbert is not a big time name. He is on an offense where he projects to be RB1, and his team seems better. I say this is a fun pick, 
							even if a big of nepotism was involved.
						</p>
						</div>
		
						<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/16800.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Davante Adams</h4>
						<p>
							Ultimate breakup. This is sad to see but I get it. Fernando isn't saying Davante sucks, he's saying Josh McDaniels sucks. And he does. That being said, Davante still put up 1500 and 14TDs regardless. 
							So.. he could be good.
						</div>

			<div class="date">Eric "2.0"</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4697815.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Rachaad White</h4>
                        <p>
                            Finally. Not a nepotism pick. I went over it earlier with Andrew, but to reiterate, Rachaad has opportunity but it may not appear as fluidly as it did last year. Proceed with caution.
                        </p>
						</div>
		
						<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4429084.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Anthony Richardson</h4>
						<p>
						Sizzling take here. While yes, Richardson stays in the free agency in our league, his ability to run and the offense supposedly becoming "Greg Roman-ish" makes 
							you think Richardson could be dominant here. I say that we will see why Lamar is special and its more than just being fast. That being said, he does have QB1 potential.
						</div>
					</div>
					</div>

					<div class="date">Sasa</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4428085.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Luke Musgrave</h4>
						<p>
						 Man, I like Musgrave. He is a dog. He ran a 4.61 at the combine at 6'6 250 and he supposedly is tearing up camp with Jordan Love. That being said, he is a rookie TE.
							I think I may even pick him up. Great pick by me as always.
						</p>
						</div>
		
						<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3043078.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Derrick Henry</h4>
						<p>
						Third times the charm eh? I tried 2 years in a row and this bastard still keeps it up.
						That being said, he has an aging O Line, no defense, and a surging Colts and Jags might knock Henry into late RB1/RB2 territory. I hope.
