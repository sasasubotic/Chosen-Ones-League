			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/recruiting/ncf/players/190/191017.jpg&w=190&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Amon-Ra St. Brown</h4>
					<p>
					Only picture I could find, is this mugshot looking one, so deep sleeper here. Ra is an interesting guy, as he is a starting WR for the Lions, and he, according
					to his coach, has been nothing short of spectacular. He's so good, Eric already picked 'em up.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">

					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Johnathan</h4>
					<p>
					Spicy take here, but I get it. Taylor is drafted as a top 5-8 RB (behind Kamara, CMC, Dalvin, Henry for sure) so you'd expect that production, but it might not happen
					this season. Taylor's issues are he has a coach who loves using 2-3 RBs consistenly (did you know Nyheim Hines had 3 games over 18 points last year?) and his QB is not 
					exactly a dump off-pass type of guy. I can see where Eric is going with this. That being said, JT is insanely talented so, he might pan out anyways.

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3916433.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Jakobi Meyers</h4>
					<p>
					I see a trend of picking guys you already have. <font color=#ff8000>cough</font> Egomaniacs <font color=#ff8000>cough</font>, but I digress. I love Meyers. His issues
					last year were Cam Newton's broken arm, and lack of TD production. If we just regress him to a mean for a guy of his yards/receptions (750 yards approx), he should've had about 6 TDs instead of 0!!!!
					Solid pick, you egomaniac.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3042519.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Aaron Jones</h4>
					<p>
						Hmm. I like the pick, I do. He's a talented back, and he's (still) playing with arguably the best QB in football. Here's where I think James is going with this.
						Green Bay is due for a TD regression. Their offense was ultra-explosive, and they had a lot of health on their front line. This year, their O-Line is already damaged
						(Bahktiari is already out), they let Lindsley go to the Chargers, and theri defense (in my opinion) is much better. So maybe less shootouts. I get this pick, just don't know if I agree.
					</p>

		<div class="date">Tommy</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4362628.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Ja'Marr Chase</h4>
					<p>
					This guy cant even see a football. He's complaining about stripes. And he, by all accounts, cannot catch a cold right now. That being said, Bengals will throw a ton, and 
					that is Dr. Burrows favorite teammate and former college target. He has the draft pedigree, and talent, and athleticism. I can see where Tommy is going with it, I just dont like it.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3117251.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Christian McCaffrey</h4>
					<p>
					WOW. This is that 10 day old Taco Bell spicy, that "chug a half bottle of Pepto Bismol" spicy baby. I love it. Here's the thing, I think he'll be good. 
					I think Tommy belives between his injury, a MUCH more talented WR group, and some solid backups, along with a coach who wants to keep him healthy this year, 
					McCaffrey's due for some regression. I'm inclined to agree.. somewhat. That being said, this guy doesn't need much to be the RB1 this year.
					</p>

		<div class="date">Aaron</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3895827.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Ty'Son Williams</h4>
					<p>
						Sigh.. <font color=#ff8000>Egomaniacs</font>. Comedy aside, I get what Aaron is going for here. Ravens always have a solid RB room, and Ty'Son SHOULD, again, SHOULD, be the RB1
						considering his competition is the 2015 RB All Pro group. He also is on a team that, with all its injuries, will be playing behind a bit, so he should get volume. 
						Wouldn't say I love it, but wouldn't be shocked if it worked out.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3052117.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Phillip Lindsay</h4>
					<p>
					I joke that Corey Davis, Brandin Cooks and Lindsay should start a group called Bad Porn. Why? Because they get the job done, even if its ugly. That being said, Lindsay is least likely
					of the group to do a good job. First of all, they won't play any games where Lindsay is going to get "run-the-clock" runs, and he's not the best pass-catcher either. I kinda love the pick.
					This all being said, he is going to get most of the volume in that backfield. So we shall see where he goes.
					</p>
				</div>

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="date">Tre</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/2587819.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Tyrell Williams</h4>
					<p>
					Gross. Just gross. Tyrell is a sleeper, just because he's fast and gets a ton of volume. I get how he could be a sleeper, especially on a team projected to win.. 5 games.
					Did you also know he averages 50 yards a game? Push that to 17 games, and he gets 850 yards this year. Not a shabby guy. That being said, Goff sucks so, he could also suck.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3925357.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Calvin Ridley</h4>
					<p>
						Go get me some water and milk, cuz this is one spicy take. To be honest with you, I don't know why Tre thinks Ridley will bust. My only idea is that he thinks 
						Ridley will be doubled and the offense will focus on play action, and feeding the pretty new weapon in Kyle Armpitts. Otherwise, maybe injury since Ridley is a tad fragile sometimes.
						I love the spicyness.

		<div class="date">Andrew</div>
		<div class="border2">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3886818.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Myles Gaskin</h4>
					<p>
					Could you people disgust me anymore? Myles Gascan? The guy who's name rhymes with TRASHCAN? Okay, its not all bad. Last year, he was seventh among RBs in 
					receiving yards (87% catch rate (second best)) and 8.3 YPT (best). So he has a chance for volume. My issue is this RB room is rather hefty, but he projects to be the lead receiever here.
					Think of him as James White if he didn't have talent. I respect the pick, but you people are monsters.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3068267.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Austin Ekeler</h4>
					<p>
					Ring the dinner bell here, we got one spicy a-meatball (do a chef's kiss here). I get why you would be off Ekeler, behind his <font color=#ff8000>mysterious</font> hamstring injury, 
					and the quality of the Chargers defense means he won't be in the receiving game as much as he usually is (which is where he generally thrives). 
					That being said, you're a monster still for this pick (but I appreciate the spice.)

						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Trevor Lawrence</h4>
						<p>
						Hey, someone without an ego! I love this pick for many non-bias reasons. Jags defense is awful, meaning Lawrence is throwing like crazy. He also has an absolutely 
						DEEP receiving core, and he's athletic enough to scramble. This all being said, he may struggle behind our piss-poor line.
						Thanks for not hurting me Will.

						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Ezekiel Elliot</h4>
						<p>
						More SPICE baby. Love it. Add some cajun crust to this 'za. I get why Will picked Zeke. He's regressed every year, and the Cowboys D is still poor. With this logic,
						the WRs should feast, and if the game last night is any indicator, Zeke will be pass blocking more often than not. This being said, Zeke is a big play guy, so who knows where he ends up.

						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Van Jefferson</h4>
						<p>
						Not gonna lie, I had no idea who this was. But upon looking 'em up, this is a deeeeeeeeep sleeper. I kinda like it. He is a former 2nd round WR, on the Rams, And
						 Kupp cannot stay healthy for the life of him, so he could end up being a steal, considering he is UNDRAFTED by our league.

						<p>
						Man, I don't wanna pile up on Mr. 12-Abs here. Read above, my fingers hurt from typing.

						<div class="date">King</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3045147.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - James Conner</h4>
						<p>
							<font color=#ff8000>Egomaniacs, the whole lot-of-ya.</font> This being said, I get King's rationale here. Let us replace Drake's attempts with Conners. 
							Drake ranked seventh among RBs in carries, eighth in rush TDs and third in carries inside the 5-yard line last year. That's probably Conner's job, as Edmonds is unquestionably, the better catcher of the two.
							We could see a Freeman - Coleman tandem here, but just way worse and less talented, and coached worse, and behind a worse line, and in the hardest division in football and..

						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Travis Kelce</h4>
						<p>
						Can always count on King for a hibachi-hottake. I love this pick. I get why King did it. Kelce was drafted as a round 1 pick, so he has to replicate what he did last year, to enforce that value.
						 This being said, Chiefs have invested in a much better line, and project to run more, so his numbers should dip, but what do we consider a bust? 
						 For me its 1000> and 8 TDs, since thats Waller-Kittle territory, who are RD 2-4 picks.

						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4361577.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Dyami Brown</h4>
						<p>
						I love me some Dyami. All training camp, he's been the Samuel guy. The carries, the catches, the RACability, etc. He's also undrafted and plays for a guy who loves his vets. 
						So, Dyami is a dart throw, but I wouldn't be shocked also if Samuel ends up not getting his job back THIS year. 
						Also wouldn't be shocked if they just use other guys instead on the WR core.

						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Derrick Henry</h4>
						<p>
						If you listen to me talk mumbo-jumbo, you know I hate Derrick Henry with a passion. Ruins my team, my fantasy team, my dreams and hopes, and he almost did it last year too.
						My reasons for Mr. Henrietta being a bust is simple. His volume is unsustainable for ANY RB in HISTORY. Every guy who reaches 2000 yards rushing tends to take a 300-500 yard dip next season. 
						Also add that they have a shiny new-old Julio Jones, and I wouldn't be shocked if they rest Henry a bit this year. I think he's more RB8-10 than 1-4.
