				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3918639.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Gerald Everett</h4>
					<p>
					Arguably the best sleeper last year in Amon St-Brown, Eric strikes some more lightning with Mr. Everett. I understand the process, as he is a YAC guy, AND all camp reports point to him dominating. That being said, this is year, what, 4 of his "breakout?"
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3126486.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Deebo Samuel</h4>
					<p>
					On the otherhand, he had arguably the worst bust with Johnathan Taylor, aka JT. This year it is DEEBO SAMUEL. And this makes sense to me. Deebo's fantasy value came from a lot of 
					runs and YACability, which he still has. But with a deeper WR room, and a potentially less accurate QB, I like this take.
					</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Christian Kirk</h4>
					<p>
						<font color=#ff8000>cough</font> Picking your own player again huh?<font color=#ff8000>cough</font><p>Per James Himself:</p>
						How did he get paid I still donâ€™t know. 
						He is good enough to be a Top 20-25 Wr consider they will be trailing a lot and he will he Sunshines #1 target. 
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4240021.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Cam Akers</h4>
					<p>
						He is coming off an Achilles injury. The man was drafted in the 1st round. 
						He will be a bust just because of where he was drafted. Plus King drafted him so why not choose him. Him and Henderson will share duties. This all being said, James bust and sleepers last year both were incorrect (Jakobi Meyers as a sleeper, Aaron Jones as a bust)
					</p>

		<div class="date">Tommy</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4426502.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Drake London</h4>
					<p>
					I love this pick but I also hate it. I love it because he is my favorite rookie WR and he is undoubtedly talented. But I hate it because Mariota is known for hypertargetting his TEs so I imagine Pitts gets more volume. 
					That being said, 800 yards seems like a solid projection for Mr. London. Great pick. 
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4242335.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - JT</h4>
					<p>
					Yet again a spicy take from Tommy. He nailed both the sleeper AND his bust last year with Chase and McCaffrey respectively. This year he picks JT, which is a tough one to think about. Despite the fact he does have an improved O-Line and QB, and his division is seemingly the worst it has been in years, JT is due for some TD regression. Now if that makes him a bust, who knows.
					</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Cole Kmet</h4>
					<p>
						Its sad because Kmet is actually very talented. If I told you Kmet with Fields was targeted 46 times in only 7 games, you'd be happy. If I told you his average depth of target was only 7 yards a attempt, you'd probably puke. But what if I told you he is the 2nd best player on this team now, and our favorite guy to bet against was fired as a coach? You might be happy.

					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Josh Jacobs</h4>
					<p>
					One RB to another, its clear that Aaron hates guys in too large committees and rumored to lose their jobs. Last years Phillip Lindsey to this years Josh Jacobs. Listen, I love Josh. But his team hates him, they drafted a RB, and are going pass heavy obviously. RIP sweet prince.
					</p>

		<div class="date">Tre</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4045163.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Miles Sanders</h4>
					<p>
					Oh I'm sleeping alright. Nyquil and melatonin sleepin'. That being said, Eagles should run more this year, and if Miles can stay healthy and not get vultured by Boston Scott and Gainwell, I could see him being a solid RB2-3. Still gross tho.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4241389.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Ceedee Lamb</h4>
					<p>
						I love this take. Tre is in the same mindset as me where we don't believe in #2/borderline 1 guys are worth the hype. As great as Ceedee was last year, we do have to account that he only had 5 weeks where he posted about 90 yards and/or a TD, and losing Cooper means more pressure and double teams on him. Tre called and nailed the Calvin Ridley bust last year, lets see if fire strikes twice.

		<div class="date">Andrew</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4360238.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Sleeper - Dameon Pierce</h4>
					<p>
					I, too, pick a player I have as a sleeper (lol). Welp, I have to admit I love Pierce. He is a violent runner, and very talented. However, I believe his value has skyrocketed due to preseason, and now we will see their shoddy O-Line and lackluster passcatchers be disregarded, limiting his value. I wouldn't be surprised if he has 3-4 weeks of dominance and 12 weeks of mediocrity. New Arian Foster though perhaps?
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4240021.png&w=350&h=254">
					</div>
					<h4>Bust - Cam Akers</h4>
					<p>
					Not to, yet again, shit on Akers, but James did that earlier. My opinion is that he is healthy and fine. RBs off Achilles injuries tend to perform roughly 20% less effectively, so he'll be, what, a RB2, but with the snaps being split with Henderson, I imagine he's a RB3 this year. So as a 1st round value... eh.

			<div class="date">Will</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4361579.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Javonte Williams</h4>
						<p>
						Hey, someone without an ego! I love this pick but yet again, also hate it. Javonte is talented. Like, 85% Nick Chubb talented. But he splits snaps with Melvin Gordon, and the camp reports say that has not changed. But like Chubb, that never stopped him from being a RB1.
					</p>
					</div>
	
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3051392.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Ezekiel Elliot</h4>
						<p>
						Literally the same pick as last year. I would analyze this but Will did it for me. And I quote "Zeke, every year I'm picking Zeke." I do concur that Zeke could be a bust but with his value being at round 2 of our redraft, or round 4 of a normal draft, if he performs as a RB2, he is about at value. That being said, the O-Line is bad and Dak is now injured.
					</div>

			<div class="date">Nando</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4047365.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Josh Jacobs</h4>
						<p>
						Well, on the otherhand, this is a very talented back if you disregard all the signs. The good part about Joshua Jacoborious is that he is a massive goal line guy, and has some catching chops. I can see where Nando went with this, but I respectively disagree.
						</p>
						</div>
		
						<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3126486.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Deebo Samuel</h4>
						<p>
						Welp, not to pile on from before, but Deebo seems to be a popular pick. If he doesnt get those goal line touches, and doesn't stay healthy, this is a very real possibility.
						</div>
					</div>
					</div>

						<div class="date">King</div>
			<div class="border2">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4427366.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Breece Hall</h4>
						<p>
							<font color=#ff8000>I didn't see this coming.</font> This being said, I get King's rationale here. Breece is similar to Saquon in athleticism testing, great college RB, the whole shabang. The problem is his QB is injured, his O-line is injured, Michael Carter is by all accounts, balling out as a 3rd down back, and Breece averaged about 2 yards per carry against second teamers. 
							But if you believe the athletic profile and talent, he could end up being a solid RB2 and possibly explode a few weeks ala young Chubb.
						</p>
						</div>
		
						<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3068267.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Austin Ekeler</h4>
						<p>
						Can always count on King for a hibachi-hottake. I don't agree, at all though. The only thing I could see happening is if Ekeler regresses in TDs, or if he gets injured. And even if he regresses, he goes from, what, RB6 to RB10? Still a top 10 guy, unless injured. 
						This pick gets the newly minted, official, shiny, Dookie Baby Turd take of the preseason.

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4360939.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Sleeper - Rashod Bateman</h4>
						<p>
						What do we love?? 2nd year wide recievers. I love Bateman, considering his pedigree and his talent last year. He is by all accounts the WR1 on the Ravens, and with a damaged RB core, I imagine they throw, a lot, or Lamar runs a lot and this pick looks dumb. Who knows.
						</p>
						</div>
		
						<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0">
						<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3043078.png&w=350&h=254">
						</div>
						<h4>Bust - Derrick Henry</h4>
						<p>
						Second times the charm eh? I tried last year and this bastard dropped 40 a game for 6 weeks straight. 
						That being said, no AJ Brown, aging O Line, no defense, and a surging Colts and Jags might knock Henry into late RB1 territory.
